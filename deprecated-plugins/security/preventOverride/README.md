Artifactory Backup Folders User Plugin
======================================

Provides you the ability to prevent override of existing artifacts to non admin users.

Adding to Artifactory
---------------------

This plugin need to be added to the `$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/plugins` directory.

Log information
---------------

Please add the following to the `$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/logback.xml` file:

For log level info:

```XML
 <logger name="preventOverride">
    <level value="info"/>
</logger>
```

This would not require restart of the Artifactory Server.

The Properties File
-------------------

Inside the properties file you can configure the paths that you want to prevent from non admin users to override artifacts.
This can configured on a repository level or for a specific path:

Exmample:
-----------

repos = [ "libs-release-local", "ForTest/prevent/override" ]

This will prevent override in the entire "libs-release-local" repository and for the path "prevent/override" in the "ForTest" repository.

In the logs:
-------------

The following can be seen in the logs:

```XML
